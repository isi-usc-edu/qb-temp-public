# qb-temp-public

This is a temporary public repository to hold images and figures.  The primary repository (https://github.com/isi-usc-edu/qb) is currently private, and images won't render property in Jupyter Notebooks if stored in a private repo and linked.  

Eventually the primary repository will be made public, and images and figures will be migrated over there.  After that, this temporary repository will be deleted.
